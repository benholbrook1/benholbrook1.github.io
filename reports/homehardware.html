        <h2>S24 @ Home Hardware</h2>
        <p>
            For the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to work as a co-op student on the Retail Helpline at Home Hardware.
            In this report, I will reflect on my time at this company and give an overview of some of the work I accomplished
            during this term.

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
            At Home Hardware, I was part of the Retail Helpline team, serving as the first point of contact for IT support
            requests from any of Home Hardware's 1,100 retail stores. My responsibilities included:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Assisting Store Owners with the initial installation of Home Hardware software and hardware products</li>
            <li>Providing ongoing technical support for these products</li>
            <li>Research and documentation of store suggestions for software enhancements</li>
            <li>Assisting stores with maintaining computer hardware and operating system troubleshooting</li>
        </ul>

    </section>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Familiarize myself with Home Hardware's retail applications</li>
            <p>
                I was eager to learn how different applications function within a real-world retail environment. I had the opportunity
                to explore the inner workings of various applications supported by the Helpline, including SQL-based POS systems and
                Android-based inventory management software. This hands-on experience allowed me to gain valuable insight into the 
                framework of production-level applications.

            </p>
            <li>Learn problem solving techniques for approaching complex service tickets</li>
            <p>
                A goal of mine while at Home Hardware was to learn how to dissect and approach a problem-solving scenario to resolve
                service tickets efficiently. Throughout the summer I had the chance to face over 850 service tickets and work through 
                the process of resolving each case. I learned the value of getting the context of the problem and ensuring I understood 
                what the customer required. I learned how to apply critical thinking and make use of internal documentation to take steps
                in solving the problem and I learned how to reach out for help when a problem could be better serviced by another one of
                Home Hardware's internal teams.

            </p>
            <li>Effective oral communication</li>
            <p>
                In this role, I gained a large amount of experience communicating with both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I
                learned how to be clear and concise in my communication and the importance of keeping everyone looped in on all parts of
                the problem-solving process. I learned how to work with difficult personalities and how to de-escalate scenarios where a
                store owner or manager might be upset.
            </p>
        </ol>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            Overall I am extremely grateful for my time at Home Hardware. I was a part of a great team, who were all willing to step in
            and help with any questions I had. I had the chance to be a part of a very professional environment and learn different technical
            and non-technical skills required to work effectively in the workplace. I enjoyed learning about the different types of software
            used at Home Hardware and will take this valuable knowledge into future opportunities. Looking back on the term, it was a fulfilling
            and rewarding experience.
