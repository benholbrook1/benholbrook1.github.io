        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
            In my time at Home Hardware I was a part of the Retial Helpline team. In this role my team and I served as
            the first point of contact for any IT support needed from any of Home Hardware's 1100 retail stores. Some of my
            responsibilities in this role were:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Assisting Store Owners with the initial instalation of Home Hardware software and hardware products</li>
            <li>Providing ongoing support for the use of these Home Hardware products</li>
            <li>Research and documentation of store suggestions for enchancements in Home Hardware's software products</li>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Familiarize myself with Home Hardware's tech stack</li>
            <p>
                In this role I was excited to get the chance to see how different applciations function and gain experience
                learning the framework of production type applications. This proved to be true as I was able to learn about the
                inner-workings of multiple different types of applications that we supported at the helpline. I worked with SQL
                based Point-Of-Sale applications and also andriod based inventory management software. 

            </p>
            <li>Learn problem solving tecniques for approaching complex service tickets</li>
            <p>
                A goal of mine while at Home Hardware was to learn how to disect and approach a problem solving scenario to resolve 
                service tickets efficiently. Throughout the summer I had the chance to face over 850 service tickets and work through
                the process of resolving each case. I learned the value in getting the context of the problem and ensuring I understood
                what the customer required, I learned how to apply critical thinking and make use of internal documentation to take steps
                in solving the problem and I learned how to reach out for help when a problem could be better serviced by another one of Home
                Hardware's internal teams.
            </p>
            <li>Effective Oral Communication</li>
            <p>
                In this role I gained a large amount of experience communicating with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
                I learned how to be clear and consise in my communication and how to keep everyone looped in in all parts of the problem
                solving process. I learned how to work with difficutlt personalities and how to de-escilate scenarios where a store owner
                or manager might be upset.
            </p>
        </ol>
